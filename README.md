# Hilbert Transformer

Originally the final project for the third-year FMF course *Zajemanje in obdelava podatkov* (Data Acquisition and Processing).
This version is more polished and intended for submission as part of my masters application to ETSETB.

The goal is to design and implement a band-pass Hilbert transformer that works in (approximately) real time.
See the report for a more detailed introduction.
