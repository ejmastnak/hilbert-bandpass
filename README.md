# Bandpass Hilbert Transformer

Project goal: design and implement a finite impulse response (FIR) band-pass Hilbert transformer that works in real-time on 44100 Hz audio signals.

Context: This was originally a project for the third-year course *Zajemanje in obdelava podatkov* (Data Acquisition and Processing) at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, which I later put on GitHub for a public audience.
